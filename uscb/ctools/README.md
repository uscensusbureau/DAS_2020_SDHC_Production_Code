# ctools

A collection of python modules that are of general use.

## Installation

ctools is built and published as a python package.  It's hosted by DAS in
Nexus at https://repo.rm.census.gov/repository/DAS_Python/.

To install the latest version on DAS systems:

```
pip install --upgrade ctools
```

To install on non-DAS systems:

```
pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url http://repo.rm.census.gov/repository/DAS_Python/ ctools
```

### Versioning

ctools versioning uses a 4 digit semantic versioning convention:
```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<build>
```
A change to the major version number indicates a significant change in functionality that is not backwards compatible with previous versions.

A change to the minor version number indicates a backwards compatible change to functionality.

A change in the patch version indicates a minor bug fix or documentation change.

A change in the build version indicates a packaging related fix that does not change functionality.

## Development

### Dependency Management
Dependencies for ctools are defined in setup.cfg

### Version Updates
The version of the package is managed in __init__.py.

Update the MAJOR, MINOR and PATCH versions as appropriate and commit the change.

Note:  Whenever a higher level value is updated, reset the lower to 0. If you increase the MAJOR version, set MINOR, PATCH and BUILD to 0.  

### Building Locally

First, ensure you are in a virtual environment to isolate any dependencies/changes:

```
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/activate
```

Next, run make to build and install the package

```
make install
```

### Jenkins Builds

Builds that pass unit tests are automatically packaged and published to Nexus by Jenkins.

The main branch build publishes "official" packages to https://repo.rm.census.gov/repository/DAS_Python/.

Non-main branch builds will publish a test package to https://repo.rm.census.gov/repository/DAS-Pypi-Test/.
