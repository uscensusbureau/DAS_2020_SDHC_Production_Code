This test checks the following:
1. State filtering is being applied. 
2. MAFID = 100000015 is case with a structural zero - this needs to be filtered out of the result. 
3. MAFID = {100000014, 100000012} tests the case that a group quarters and non group quarters facility are 
    located in the same geo. 
4. The algorithm creates non-private results.
